## 2024 April
No commits recorded for this month.

## 2024 March
Introduction of the Terra module system with initial commits for Terra-related functionality and module updates. This appears to be the beginning of a new major feature addition to the engine.

## 2024 February
Substantial work on OpenXR and buffer management features. Enhanced OpenXR Input Changed Events to report previous values, eliminating the need for higher-level code to cache values. Implemented proper support for read-only and write-only buffer flags that map to Vulkan transfer bits. Various merge conflicts were resolved and rendering system fixes were applied.

## 2024 January
No commits recorded for this month.

## 2023 December
Development concentrated on UI interaction improvements, specifically exposing methods to get hovered Control elements in Viewport through GDScript bindings. This enhancement allows developers to better track mouse interactions with UI elements in their applications.

## 2023 November
No commits recorded for this month.

## 2023 October
Work focused on core engine improvements with a fix to the AABB Ray Intersection function that was incorrectly returning per-axis t values, now properly tested and working consistently with intersects_segment. Additionally, implemented support for read-only and write-only buffers in the rendering system.
